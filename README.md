# Poring

Poring is an IRC bot written in TypeScript. This is a personal project that doesn't aim to achieve anything in particular. You can find it at [#f1@libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) under the name "poring."

# Development

## Database

The bot needs a [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) instance. I suggest running MariaDB in a docker container. Here is my compose file for local development:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
```

Once it's running:

1. Create a scema with `./spec/schema.sql`
2. Populate it with `./spec/data.sql`

## Bot

Ccopy `example.env` to `.env` and modify it to your liking.

Then you have two options how to run the bot:

1. Use a dev container in VS Code.
2. Install npm on your host.

When either environment is ready, do as follows:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run tests:

```
npm run test
```

# Features

## Countdown

The bot can show you the countdown to the next Formula 1 session in various silly units:

- `!ceeks` for how many weeks are left until the next session
- `!supermax` for how many [Super Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBJCgrrQhx4) songs you can listen to while waiting for the next session
- `!dogs` for how many dog years are left until the next session
- `!blinks` for how many eye blinks you can make while waiting for the next session

It makes calls to [raweceek.eu](https://raweceek.eu/) to retrieve this data.

## Next

Each morning at 08:30 Tallinn time, the bot sends `!n` to #f1. I used to do this myself, but my new IRC client doesn't support that kind of functionality. This is our little tradition.

## Poring Actions

The bot also has a bit of personality. Periodically, it sends a `/me` action to #f1, acting as a poring creature from Ragnarok Online.

An example:

```
* poring bounces gently on the soft grass
```
