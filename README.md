# Poring

Poring is an IRC bot written in TypeScript. This is a personal project that doesn't aim to achieve anything in particular. You can find it at [#f1@libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) under the name "poring."

# Features

## Countdown

The bot can show you the countdown to the next Formula 1 session in various silly units:

- `!ceeks` for how many weeks are left until the next session
- `!supermax` for how many [Super Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBJCgrrQhx4) songs you can listen to while waiting for the next session
- `!dogs` for how many dog years are left until the next session
- `!blinks` for how many eye blinks you can make while waiting for the next session

It makes calls to [raweceek.eu](https://raweceek.eu/) to retrieve this data.

## Next

Each morning at 08:30 Tallinn time, the bot sends `!n` to #f1. I used to do this myself, but my new IRC client doesn't support that kind of functionality. This is our little tradition.

## Poring Actions

The bot also has a bit of personality. Periodically, within a range of one to seven days, it sends a `/me` action to #f1, acting as a poring creature from Ragnarok Online.

An example:

```
* poring bounces gently on the soft grass
